### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Samuel Ramirez, I am 17 years old and a junior in high school. (This is for the GitHub Course). I am trying to learn how to become a successful web developer and game creator as a hobby, as well as if I can learn how to, become a freelance web developer as a job throughout college.
